## Contributing

**NOTE:** A more structured guide will be written soon!

To contribute your own code, start by forking this project and installing the necessary dependencies listed below.

After installing the dependencies, you can build the project with `cargo build --release`.

NOTE: A few packages will be downloaded and installed, so the first time may take significantly longer than subsequent builds.

The binary will be created in `./target/release/`, named `corrosionwm`.

> ðŸ’¡ You can also use `cargo run --release` to run the project!

You can now edit the source code and rebuild the project.
Test your changes by running the `corrosionwm` file.

When you have finished making all of your changes, commit them using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and create a pull request.
